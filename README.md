# Cloud Database Example

### Description
This is an app that lets you make and manage a database for customers and orders

### How to set it up
You'll need an IDE with Python 3 set up on it, as well as your own Google Cloud Firebase account, and you'll need to set up a service account and get a private key to plug into the main.py program.

### How to build
It's in Python, so it should be built into your IDE. It's integrated, after all.

### Helpful API commands I used
I mean most of what I did had to do with API commands, so...a lot of 
        db.collection("collection_name").document("document_name").set() and .get() and .delete() and .stream()
...as a small sample.
