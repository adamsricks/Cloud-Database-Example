# Cloud Database Example

### Description
This is an app that lets you make and manage a database for customers and orders

### How to set it up
You'll need an IDE with Python 3 set up on it, as well as your own Google Cloud Firebase account, and you'll need to set up a service account and get a private key to plug into the main.py program.
